Bug with simplify on copy.smt2

Plugin:

 set a time out on jobs
 enabling problem navigation
 reporting exception errors better
 result matrix
 cancelling running job, including long-running solver tasks
 undocked progress monitor
 finish moving strings to properties files
 distinguish dirty files in the console
 allow loading preferences from jsmtlib.properties file by button push
 implement a way to easily add new solvers (either pure SMT or new adapters)
 unsupported responses should be shown in the editor as markers
 errors should be shown in the console window as well
 have a progress monitor
 put in a multipage editor with output to alternate page
 output to a new popup widow
 * expand the HELP document
 * implement options
 DONE - implement different solvers 
 DONE - implement markers for errors
 DONE ENOUGH - find out how repairing syntax coloring works
 implement font differences along with coloring for syntax coloring
 DONE - find out how to grab the current (dirty) content of a editor
 implement connections to various solvers
 DONE - fix the icons
 DONE - editor: real-time checking; 
 editor: customizing the syntax coloring
 editor: allowing fonts for syntax coloring
 editor: word-completion with reserved words
 DONE - allow multiple selections in context menu
 DONE - no tooltip information when hovering over a marker in an editor
 DONE - plugin does not find logics in classpath
 DONE - control-shift-S does not work to save all dirty SMT editors - NOTE: needs to be explicitly set in the Keys preferences
 The list of logics updates when Apply is pushed ; can it update when the logic directory field is changed?
 Can we make a menu of logics to view that is appropriately dynamic?
 Can we make the default logic Path be a location within the plugin?
 Would like to have the list of solvers (in preferences and in the menu) be dynamic
 Hover information: e.g. type, value in current model
 Symbolic execution given a model
 Navigate to matching ( ); highlight matching ()
 Change selection to left sibling, right sibling, first child, last child, parent
 Find definition
 Find references
 Rename
 Refactor to add, remove a let
 Refactor to add, remove a sort or fcn definition
 Combine or split asserts
 Pretty print/reformat
 showing markers on linked files that are not in the project
 Enable/disable auto typechecking
 Add an another tool bar button solely for type-checking
 Help document
 Show non-OK responses in a plug-in window
 Show get-value responses as a tooltip
 Show logic of the selected file, if no text is selected
 
App
 cleanup connection of configuration to solvers, e.g. verbosity, print success, logic
 should other SMT options become app options?
 textual error messages with locations indicated for batch processing
 handle reading and checking "par" declarations
 handle restrictions on attributes in logic and theory
 tie sort and fcn parameters to their declarations - will need corresponding visitors
* checking that expressions are valid in the logic
 general handling of sort with parameterized identifiers
 DONE - implement properties for solver executables and reading a properties file
* implement strict smtlib behavior
* refactor the implementation of bit-vector functions.  They are all hand-coded. 
  Although SMT defines them all informally, we need a cleaner way to implement
  and add to the set of functions within the software.
Saw crashes when using the driver with multiple commands
Pretty print mode
Clean up the code for showing values, maintaining state


Bugs
 problem with showing error locations that span lines
 expressions containing let-bound parameters bound to unclosed expressions are not recognized as unclosed
 if properties file is to be read from the directory containing the .jar file, 
    the .jar file must be named jSMTLIB.jar
     
Document
 comment on strict smtlib behavior
 
Adapters:
** finish solver adapters
** implement bitvector extensions
 figure out how to handle sorts within Simplify
 implement options and info in other solvers
