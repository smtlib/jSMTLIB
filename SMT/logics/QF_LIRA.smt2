 "Closed formulas built over arbitrary expansions of the Reals_Ints and
  ArraysEx signatures with free constant symbols, but with the
  following restrictions:
  - all terms of sort Int are linear, that is, have no occurrences of the
    function symbols *, /, div, mod, and abs, except as specified in the 
    :extensions attributes;
  - all terms of sort Real are linear, that is, have no occurrences of the
    function symbols * and /, except as specified in the 
    :extensions attribute;
  - all array terms have sort 
    (Array Int Real) or 
    (Array Int (Array Int Real)).

 "For every operator op with declaration (op Real Real s) for some sort s,
  and every term t1, t2 of sort Int and t of sort Real, the expression 
  - (op t1 t) is syntactic sugar for (op (to_real t1) t)
  - (op t t1) is syntactic sugar for (op t (to_real t1))
  - (/ t1 t2) is syntactic sugar for (/ (to_real t1) (to_real t2))

 "Real or Int terms with _concrete_ coefficients are also allowed, that is,
  terms of the form (* c x), or (* x c) where
  x is a free constant of sort Int or Real and 
  c is an integer or rational coefficient, respectively. 
  - An integer coefficient is a term of the form m or (- m) for some
    numeral m.
  - A rational coefficient is a term of the form d, (- d) or (/ c n) 
    for some decimal d, integer coefficient c and numeral n other than 0.
